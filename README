Lab7 assignment for polymorphism

1. How to compoile ? 
 -> use the command "make" in the command windows

2. How to execute ? 
 -> use the command "./lab7" after makefile processing in the command windows

3. what's this assignment about ? 

 -> for lab7, it can arbitrarily produce 10 mino blocks including 'T' , 'S' ,'I'	and 'L .
 -> there still another function, for example , turn function can make the mino 	rotate about 90 degree and become different types.

4. why do we do this ?

 -> just for a simple development of a mino game, and use some basic concept of 	inheritance and polymorphism.
